0.3.0
-----

* New option --tranfer-sleep-lock gives lockers control over the inhibit delay.
  Two bash scripts are included to use this with existing lockers. (Bumps
  required glib version from 2.30 to 2.32.)

* Don't kill locker on forced ScreenSaverOff event. This resulted in killing
  the locker upon returning to the VT running X after switching to another VT.
  Since there is no reliable way to detect VT-switching, this is necessary to
  keep things secure without enabling DontVTSwitch in xorg.conf.

  Now the only difference between `xset s reset` and sending SIGHUP to xss-lock
  (while the locker is active) is that the former resets the idle hint and
  (with DPMS) turns the screen back on. Killing the locker process directly is
  now the only way to deactivate the locker programmatically. Perhaps the next
  release will include something like `xss-lock-command` to provide more
  fine-grained control over a running xss-lock instance.

* Type 'm' for tmpfiles.d introduced in systemd-208 is more suitable for
  modifying sysfs brightness file permissions.

* Add zsh and bash completion.

* Update man page.

0.2.2
-----

* Updated dim-screen script (fading, configuration at the top).

0.2.1
-----

* New options: --quiet and --verbose.

0.2.0
-----

* Fix bugs related to notifier and (--ignore-)sleep.

0.1.1
-----

* Warning message for additional X errors that pop up in the event loop.

* Allow building with glib>=2.30 (exit status of notifier/locker is not
  checked for <2.34).

* Typo fixes and other small improvements to documentation.
